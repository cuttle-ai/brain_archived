//Package visualizations has the utilities for creating the visualizations
//for data like bar graph, scatter plot etc. This doesn't generate the images
//of the visualizations. It will provide models and which states the parameters
//required for creating visualization. E.g. For creating a bar graph, it does
//require to know what metric come on x axis and on y-axis?. What are the formats
//that has to be applied while displaying the values in the graph?. This package
//facilitates the answers for these sort of questions.
